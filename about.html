<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<hr>
<p>when you dont have a goal everything seems like an opportunity".<br>
My favorite quote!<br>
Just about 5 years ago i ventured into the tech world with high hopes which i still have though even tho i have not gotten my fill of it.<br>
I graduated at Ahmadu Bello University Zaria Nigeria, where i earned my first degree in quantity surveing (HONORS),<br>
I believe everything has its time and season and so does everyone as well. I go about doing whatever i do with that at the back of my mind.
i am a goal oriented person, good at multitasking but never lose sight of my goal in whatever i do.</p>
